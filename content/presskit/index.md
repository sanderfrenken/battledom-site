## Description

Battledom is an iOS game in development since October 2022. Battledom is currently in an alpha testing stage. 

Battledom is best described as an RTS-lite game that involves resource management and real time battles.

Its designed with mobile/ tablet usage on top of mind. One can play Battledom for short periods of time and still make progress, while longer periods of time can also be spent continuously.

I see Battledom as an homage to the classic RTS genre, but now designed with mobile gaming in mind.

## History

I started Battledom development in 2022. It started as an experiment: After the release of [Herodom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/herodom/id1371997444), a successful Tower defense game for iOS, I was aiming to create a more dynamic battle mechanic. 

Using [GamePlayKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit), I was able to create a performant system that enabled me to control larger groups of units. Steering their behavior with different actions, I was enjoying myself guiding my armies through large maps, looking for enemies to defeat.

It was this mechanic that I expanded upon, and led to the foundation of Battledom: a simple mobile RTS. For the resource management part I took my inspiration from various idle games, which I think fits well for a mobile RTS: one can easily pick and play for a couple of minutes, gather some resources, and come back later.

In Q4 2024 Battledom was nearing completion, at least mechanic wise. At this stage, play testing has started and the focus is on adding additional content.
